      The giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera forms
      subtidal forests on shallow reefs in temperate regions of the
      world. It is one of the fastest-growing multicellular autotrophs
      on Earth and its high productivity supports diverse marine food
      webs. In 2008, we published a method for estimating biomass and
      net primary production (NPP) of giant kelp along with five years
      of data, to provide a more integrated measure of NPP than those
      yielded by previous methods. Our method combines monthly field
      measurements of standing crop and loss rates with a model of kelp
      biomass dynamics to estimate instantaneous mass-specific growth
      rates and NPP for each season of each year. We have since improved
      our approach to account for several previously unresolved sources
      of biomass loss. These improvements have led to a near doubling of
      our prior estimates of growth and NPP. At our site with the most
      persistent stand of giant kelp, NPP averages ~5.2 kg dry mass
      m-2 y-1 and
      results from the rapid growth (~3.5% per day) of a relatively
      small standing biomass (~ 0.4 kg dry mass
      m-2 on average) that turns over ~ 12
      times annually. Here we provide revised estimates of seasonal
      biomass, growth and NPP for the five years covered by our previous
      publication (2002-2006), along with an additional data collect
      since then (2007-present). We also present updated relationships
      for predicting giant kelp biomass and NPP from much more easily
      obtained measurements of frond density. These data can be used to
      understand the mechanisms that drive variation in giant kelp NPP
      at a wide range of temporal scales.

               The Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER) is an interdisciplinary research and education program
established in April 2000 with the goal of developing a predictive understanding of how environmental
drivers interact with terrestrial and oceanic processes to alter material flows and influence the ecology of
coastal ecosystems. SBC LTER's principal study domain is the semi-arid coast and nearshore waters of
the Santa Barbara Channel in southern California, and its diverse and productive marine forests of giant
kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) serve as the focal study ecosystem. Analyses of our long-term data have
identified many of the environmental drivers and ecological processes underlying the production and
community dynamics of kelp forests. The research proposed to address this question is integrated in a conceptual framework
that focuses on the causes and ecological consequences of the dynamics of a relatively short-lived
foundation species in a setting of long-term climate change and human use.
            
         
         
            SBC LTER is supported by the National Science Foundation.

               Growth rate dry
               The instantaneous growth rate of M. pyrifera dry mass (d-1) for each season of each year. This variable is calculated as the growth rate necessary to explain the observed change in biomass during each period, given the initial biomass and the independently measured loss rates. Growth rates for all days in each season are averaged.

               FSC nitrogen
               The nitrogen mass of the foliar standing crop of M. pyrifera (kg m-2, excluding sporophylls and holdfast). These data are obtained by calculating the nitrogen mass of each plant, measuring standing crop, and dividing the total nitrogen mass of all plants in the plot by the area of the plot. Plants without at least one frond longer than 1m are excluded.

               Carbon lost as blades
               The rate of carbon mass lost in the form of deteriorating blades due to senescence (kg m-2 d-1). These data are obtained by calculating the total carbon mass of senescing blades lost for the period and dividing by the number of days elapsed.

               Carbon lost as dissolved
               The rate of carbon mass lost in the form of dissolved organic matter (kg m-2 d-1). These data are obtained by calculating the total carbon mass of dissolved matter lost for the period and dividing by the number of days elapsed. These data are equivalent to production and release of dissolved carbon by M. pyrifera.

               Standard error of FSC_dry. The error in dry mass includes two types of error. Observer error consists of errors made in the number of plants sampled and in the measurement of their size. Regression errors include variability in the allometric relationships used to calculate the size of the three plant sections, as well as uncertainty in the length:wet-mass and wet-mass:dry-mass conversion ratios.
