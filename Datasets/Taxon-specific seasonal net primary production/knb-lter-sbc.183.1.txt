      This dataset provides estimates of seasonal net primary production
      (NPP) for all taxa of macroalgae sampled in fixed plots of the SBC
      LTER's seasonal kelp forest monitoring sites. The five reefs
      (Arroyo Quemada 34°28.048’N, 120°07.031’W; Carpinteria
      34°23.474’N, 119°32.510’W; Isla Vista 34°23.275’N, 119°32.792’W;
      Mohawk 34°23.649’N, 119°43.762’W; and Naples 34° 25.342’N, 119°
      57.102’W) ranged in depth from 5.8 m to 8.9 m (MLLW) and were
      chosen to represent a range of physical and biological
      characteristics known to influence subtidal macroalgal assemblages
      in the region. NPP of understory taxa was calculated using field
      measurements of irradiance and biomass (derived from abundance)
      and laboratory estimates of taxon-specific photosynthetic
      parameters. NPP for the giant kelp, Macrocystis
      pyrifera, was calculated using linear relationships
      between frond density in a given season and average NPP for that
      season.

               The Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER) is an interdisciplinary research and education program
established in April 2000 with the goal of developing a predictive understanding of how environmental
drivers interact with terrestrial and oceanic processes to alter material flows and influence the ecology of
coastal ecosystems. SBC LTER's principal study domain is the semi-arid coast and nearshore waters of
the Santa Barbara Channel in southern California, and its diverse and productive marine forests of giant
kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) serve as the focal study ecosystem. Analyses of our long-term data have
identified many of the environmental drivers and ecological processes underlying the production and
community dynamics of kelp forests. The research proposed to address this question is integrated in a conceptual framework
that focuses on the causes and ecological consequences of the dynamics of a relatively short-lived
foundation species in a setting of long-term climate change and human use.
            
         
         
            SBC LTER is supported by the National Science Foundation.
