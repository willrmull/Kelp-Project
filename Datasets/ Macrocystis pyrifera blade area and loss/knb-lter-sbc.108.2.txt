  These data describe losses of giant kelp (Macrocystis
  pyrifera) blade tissue observed in the Santa Barbara
  Channel (Isla Vista Reef) during the summer of 2012. Data are
  contained in two tables: 1) a time series of measured change in blade
  area over time at different depths and locations in the kelp forest,
  2) modeled estimates of partial blade losses specific to blades on
  subsurface fronds and blades in the water column and canopy sections
  of surface reaching fronds.

  The giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, supports
  one of the most productive ecosystems on Earth and this high
  productivity is driven by rapid growth and frequent turnover of
  standing biomass. Losses of entire individuals, entire fronds and of
  dissolved exudates have been studied at length by the Santa Barbara
  Coastal Long Term Ecological Research program. However, before an
  M. pyrifera frond or individual is detached, a
  portion of the blade biomass on the frond is lost and this material
  may constitute a significant proportion of giant kelp’s productivity.
  This study uses a combination of field measurements and mathematical
  modeling to estimate daily loss rates of blade tissue found on intact
  kelp fronds that compose the standing biomass.

          The Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER) is an interdisciplinary research and education program
established in April 2000 with the goal of developing a predictive understanding of how environmental
drivers interact with terrestrial and oceanic processes to alter material flows and influence the ecology of
coastal ecosystems. SBC LTER's principal study domain is the semi-arid coast and nearshore waters of
the Santa Barbara Channel in southern California, and its diverse and productive marine forests of giant
kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) serve as the focal study ecosystem. Analyses of our long-term data have
identified many of the environmental drivers and ecological processes underlying the production and
community dynamics of kelp forests. The research proposed to address this question is integrated in a conceptual framework
that focuses on the causes and ecological consequences of the dynamics of a relatively short-lived
foundation species in a setting of long-term climate change and human use.
