    These data describe 1987-2019 time series of giant kelp
    (Macrocystis pyrifera) biomass and associated
    environmental variables (wave height, nitrate concentration, climate
    indices) at quarterly and annual time intervals. Data for spatially
    resolvable variables (giant kelp biomass, wave height, nitrate
    concentration) pertain to 361 coastline segments (500 m length) in
    southern and central California where giant kelp was persistent over
    the sampling period. Data are contained in 5 tables: 1) quarterly
    time series of giant kelp biomass, wave height, and nitrate
    concentrations for 361 coastline segments; 2) quarterly time series
    of aspatial climate indices (NPGO, MEI, PDO); 3) annual time series
    of giant kelp biomass, wave height, and nitrate concentrations for
    361 coastline segments; 4) annual time series of aspatial climate
    indices (NPGO, MEI, PDO); 5) locations (latitude and longitude of
    center) of coastline segments. Kelp data are derived from satellite
    imagery using empirical relationships. Wave data are derived from an
    empirically validated swell propagation model. Nitrate data are
    derived from empirical relationships with remotely-sensed sea
    surface temperature.

    Giant kelp is a globally-distributed species that forms a
    conspicuous monospecific surface canopy that makes it amenable to
    remote measurement over large areas and decadal time-spans. We
    developed 33-year time series (1987 through 2019) of annual mean
    giant kelp canopy wet biomass (kg) for coastline segments spanning
    southern and central California, USA by calibrating satellite remote
    sensing data to field observations. Methods are described in detail
    in Cavanaugh et al. (2011) and Bell
    et al. (2020), and briefly summarized here. The
    fraction of kelp cover in Landsat images (30 m × 30 m pixels) was
    estimated using a spectral unmixing algorithm with kelp and water
    endmembers. An empirical relationship was used to convert the
    satellite-derived kelp cover data to kelp biomass. The data were
    spatially aggregated to 500 m segments of mainland coastline, and
    are provided at two temporal resolutions: quarterly (Q1 = Jan – Mar,
    Q2 = Apr – Jun, Q3 = Jul – Sep, Q4 = Oct – Dec) and annual. Data
    were annualized by averaging. We selected coastline segments where
    kelp was absent (zero or no data) for no more than 3 years during
    the study period to focus on sites where kelp was largely persistent
    throughout the study period. Of 437 coastline segments for which
    kelp was present in at least one year, 361 (83%) were selected for
    inclusion in this dataset.
  
            
    We also obtained data on key environmental drivers of giant kelp
    dynamics: wave intensity, seawater nitrate concentration, and three
    climate indices: the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) index,
    the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index, and the Multivariate El
    Niño Index (MEI). Annual average maximum significant wave heights
    were obtained from the CDIP MOP v1.1 model
    (http://cdip.ucsd.edu/MOP_v1.1/) and aggregated to 500 m coastline
    segments. Briefly, the model combines hourly empirical measurements
    of significant wave height and direction (from the U.S. National
    Buoy Data Center, NBDC) with swell propagation and swell hindcast
    models (Wingeart et al. 2002, Hanson
    et al. 2009, O’Rielly et
    al. 2016). Wave data were then hindcasted to 1987
    following methods described in Bell et al.
    (2015).
  
            
    We computed surface seawater nitrate concentrations for each 500 m
    segment using established empirical relationships between nitrate
    concentration and sea surface temperature (Zimmerman & Kremer
    1984, Palacios et al. 2013, Snyder et
    al. 2020). Sea surface temperature estimates were
    obtained from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer satellite
    imagery (Reynolds et al. 2007, Banzon
    et al. 2016). Values of the NPGO index were
    obtained from Di Lorenzo et al. (2008). Values
    of the PDO index were obtained from
    https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/teleconnections/pdo/. Values of the MEI
    were obtained from https://psl.noaa.gov/enso/mei/. Note that unlike
    the kelp, wave, and nitrate data, the climate indices do not vary
    spatially.

          The Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER) is an interdisciplinary research and education program
established in April 2000 with the goal of developing a predictive understanding of how environmental
drivers interact with terrestrial and oceanic processes to alter material flows and influence the ecology of
coastal ecosystems. SBC LTER's principal study domain is the semi-arid coast and nearshore waters of
the Santa Barbara Channel in southern California, and its diverse and productive marine forests of giant
kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) serve as the focal study ecosystem. Analyses of our long-term data have
identified many of the environmental drivers and ecological processes underlying the production and
community dynamics of kelp forests. The research proposed to address this question is integrated in a conceptual framework
that focuses on the causes and ecological consequences of the dynamics of a relatively short-lived
foundation species in a setting of long-term climate change and human use.
